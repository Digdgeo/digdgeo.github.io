				<p><b>Professional:</b><br>

				<p>I have a degree in Geography from the University of Granada. The last year of my career I was given an Erasmus scholarship to France, but I finally opted for a Seneca/SICUE scholarship in Salamanca, where I finished the degree.</p>

				<p>I have worked as an Expert in GIS since 2006 and since 2014, as an Expert in GIS and Remote Sensing. I came to Python by chance, as a tool to program loops in ArcGIS. With the passage of time and many courses and some books, Python has become my main working tool, replacing ArcGIS first and QGIS later.</p>

				<p>I know something about HTML, Javascript and CSS (and very little Java, which I also forget very quickly). I dream of learning R, but I still have so much to learn from Python that I can't find time for it.</p>

				<p>In python I mainly work with rasterio, fiona and shapely. And also a bunch of other wonderful libraries that allow me interact with spatial data. I would not say that I have very strong Python skills, but at least I can solve the daily problems (puzzles) that are posed to me.</p>

				<p><b>Personal:</b><br>

				<p>I am Lucia's lucky father and at the same time, a poor and for ever sad widower, in the midst of the 40's crisis and in the process of change (actually, the change is already made) from young athlete to old fat man. <br>My hobbies have been reduced to surfing in Portugal or Cadiz once in a blue moon, and a couple of paddle tennis games per week (yes, paddle tennis. Just like José María Aznar, shame on me!)</p>
